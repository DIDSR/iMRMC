<h5>iMRMC</h5>

Desc: The primary objective of the iMRMC application is to assist investigators with analyzing and sizing multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) reader studies that compare the difference in the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (AUCs) from two modalities. The core elements of this application include the ability to perform MRMC variance analysis, the ability to size an MRMC trial, and a database containing components of variance from past MRMC studies. The iMRMC application is a stand-alone, precompiled, license-free Java applications and the source code. 

<h5>iRoeMetz</h5>

Desc: The iRoeMetz application can be used to simulate the reader scores for MRMC experiments via Monte Carlo methods given variance components of the ROC scores. The application also estimates the variance components of AUC and can calculate the variance components directly with numerical integration. The simulated experiments can be saved and used in MRMC variance analysis programs, such as iMRMC. The iRoeMetz application is a stand-alone, precompiled, license-free Java applications and the source code.
