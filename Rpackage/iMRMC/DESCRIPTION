Description: This software does Multi-Reader, Multi-Case (MRMC) analyses of data from imaging studies where clinicians (readers) evaluate patient images (cases). What does this mean? ... Many imaging studies are designed so that every reader reads every case in all modalities, a fully-crossed study. In this case, the data is cross-correlated, and we consider the readers and cases to be cross-correlated random effects. An MRMC analysis accounts for the variability and correlations from the readers and cases when estimating variances, confidence intervals, and p-values. The functions in this package can treat arbitrary study designs and studies with missing data, not just fully-crossed study designs. An overview of this software, including references presenting details on the methods, can be found here: <https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/science-and-research-medical-devices/imrmc-software-do-multi-reader-multi-case-statistical-analysis-reader-studies>.
