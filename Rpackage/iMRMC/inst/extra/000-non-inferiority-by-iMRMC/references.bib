  abstract = {A method is proposed for comparing the accuracy of diagnostic tests that rely on a reader's subjective interpretation of the results. An ANOVA approach is applied where the dependencies between the readers' estimates of diagnostic accuracy are handled by adjusting the usual F statistic for the estimated correlation. The distribution of the resulting test statistic is evaluated. The problem is particularly relevant to diagnostic radiology where multi-reader studies of the indices associated with the ROC curve serve important roles in evaluating the efficacy of diagnostic tests.},

  abstract = {Rationale and Objectives Multi-reader imaging trials often use a factorial design, where study patients undergo testing with all imaging modalities and readers interpret the results of all tests for all patients. A drawback of the design is the large number of interpretations required of each reader. Split-plot designs have been proposed as an alternative, in which one or a subset of readers interprets all images of a sample of patients, while other readers interpret the images of other samples of patients. In this paper we compare three methods of analysis for the split-plot design. Materials and Methods Three statistical methods are presented: Obuchowski-Rockette method modified for the split-plot design, a newly proposed marginal-mean ANOVA approach, and an extension of the three-sample U-statistic method. A simulation study using the Roe-Metz model was performed to compare the type I error rate, power and confidence interval coverage of the three test statistics. Results The type I error rates for all three methods are close to the nominal level but tend to be slightly conservative. The statistical power is nearly identical for the three methods. The coverage of 95\% CIs fall close to the nominal coverage for small and large sample sizes. Conclusions The split-plot MRMC study design can be statistically efficient compared with the factorial design, reducing the number of interpretations required per reader. Three methods of analysis, shown to have nominal type I error rate, similar power, and nominal CI coverage, are available for this study design.},
