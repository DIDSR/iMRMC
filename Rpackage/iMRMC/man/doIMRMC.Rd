\usage{
doIMRMC(
  data = NULL,
  fileName = NULL,
  workDir = NULL,
  iMRMCjarFullPath = NULL,
  stripDatesForTests = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{This data.frame contains the following variables:
\itemize{
  \item \code{readerID} Factor with levels like "reader1", "reader2", ...
  \item \code{caseID} Factor with levels like "case1", "case2", ...
  \item \code{modalityID} Factor with levels like "modality1", "modality2", ...
  \item \code{score} num reader score
}
                     
Each row of this data frame corresponds to an observation.
For every caseID, there must be a row corresponding to the truth observation.
The readerID for a truth observation is "truth".
The modalityID for a truth observation is "truth".
The score for a truth observation must be either 0 (signal-absent) or 1 (signal-present).}

\item{fileName}{This character string identifies the location of an iMRMC input file.
The input file is identical to data except there is a free text section to start,
then a line with "BEGIN DATA:", then the data frame info.}

\item{workDir}{This character string determines the directory where intermediate results
are written. If this parameter is not set, the program writes the intermediate
results to the directory specified by tempdir() and then deletes them.}

\item{iMRMCjarFullPath}{This character string identifies the location of the iMRMC.jar file
this jar file can be downloaded from https://github.com/DIDSR/iMRMC/releases
this R program supports version iMRMC-v3p2.jar}

\item{stripDatesForTests}{Since results include a date and time stamp, these need to be
stripped out when doing the package tests. This parameter flags whether or not
the dates should be stripped out.}

[list] 
           iMRMC outputs. The objects of this list are described in detail in the iMRMC documentation
           which can be found at <http://didsr.github.io/iMRMC/000_iMRMC/userManualHTML/index.htm>

           Here is a quick summary:
\itemize{
  \item {\code{perReader} 
  data.frame containing the performance results for each reader.
             Key variables of this data frame are AUCA, AUCB, AUCAminusAUCB and the corresponding
             variances, confidence intervals, degrees of freedom and p-values.}
  \item {\code{Ustat}
  data.frame containing the reader-average performance results.
             The analysis results are based on U-statistics and the papers listed above.
             Key variables of this data frame are AUCA, AUCB, AUCAminusAUCB and the corresponding
             variances, confidence intervals, degrees of freedom and p-values.}
  \item {\code{MLEstat}
  data.frame containing the reader-average performance results.
             The analysis results are based on V-statistics, which approximates the true distribution with
             the empirical distribution. The empirical distribution equals the nonparametric MLE
             estimate of the true distribution, which is also equivalent to the ideal bootstrap estimate.
             Please refer to the papers listed above.
             Key variables of this data frame are AUCA, AUCB, AUCAminusAUCB and the corresponding
             variances, confidence intervals, degrees of freedom and p-values.
  }
  \item {\code{ROC}
  list containing ROC curves
             There is an ROC curve for every combination of reader and modality.
             For every modality, there are also four average ROC curves. These are discussed in
               Chen2014_Br-J-Radiol_v87p20140016.
               The diagonal average averages the reader-specific ROC curves along y = -x + b for b in (0,1).
               The horizontal average averages the reader specific ROC curves along y = b for b in (0,1).
               The vertical average averages the reader specific ROC curves along x = b for b in (0,1).
               The pooled average ignores readerID and pools all the scores together to create one ROC curve.}
  \item {\code{varDecomp}
  list containing different decompositions of the total variance.
             Please refer to Gallas2009_Commun-Stat-A-Theor_v38p2586 (framework paper).
             The different decompositions are BCK, BDG, DBM, MS, OR.

\description{
doIMRMC takes ROC data as a data frame and runs a multi-reader multi-case analysis
based on U-statistics as described in the following papers
Gallas2006_Acad-Radiol_v13p353 (single-modality),
Gallas2008_Neural-Networks_v21p387 (multiple modalities, arbitrary study designs),
Gallas2009_Commun-Stat-A-Theor_v38p2586 (framework paper).

\details{
In detail, this procedure reads the name of an input file from the local file system,
or takes a data frame and writes it to the local file system formatted
for the iMRMC program (found at https://github.com/DIDSR/iMRMC/releases), it executes a java app,
the iMRMC engine, which writes the results to the local files system, it reads the analysis results from
the local file system, packs the analysis results into a list object, deletes the data and analysis results
from the local file system, and returns the list object.

This software requires Java(>=8).

The examples took too long for CRAN to accept. So here is an example: 
\preformatted{
# Create a sample configuration file
config <- sim.gRoeMetz.config()
# Simulate an MRMC ROC data set
dFrame.imrmc <- sim.gRoeMetz(config)
# Analyze the MRMC ROC data
result <- doIMRMC(dFrame.imrmc)
}
}
