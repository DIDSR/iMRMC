=Data Format for ROC Ratings=
Here we describe a properly formatted file of ROC ratings. These instructions can also be accessed via the “Format Info.” button.

The file format has two parts: the study description at the top followed by a list of ROC ratings. The study description can include any information as free text. It must include four lines corresponding to the size of the experiment and then conclude with a line stating “BEGIN DATA”. We demonstrate the formatting of these lines in an example. If the study has 9 readers, 55 diseased patients, and 75 non-diseased patients, and 5 modalities, then a legitimate study description can be nothing more than the following lines:

{{{
N0: 75
N1: 55
NR: 9
NM: 5
BEGIN DATA
… …
}}}

The list of ROC ratings has a row for each reader scoring each case for each modality in the study, in any order. It also has rows specifying the truth state of each case (given by the reference gold-standard reader = truth). iMRMC can handle data that is not fully-crossed for any number of modalities, though only two of those modalities may be used at a time for variance analysis.

For rows recording reader scores, there are four fields in the following order ( *no* *spaces* *allowed* ):
  * the reader id  (integer)
  * case id        (integer)
  * modality index (integer)
  * score (integer or float)

For rows recording truth states, there are also four fields in the following order ( *no* *spaces* *allowed* ):
  * -1
  * case id        (integer)
  * 0
  * truth state (0 or 1)

The truth state 0 indicates normal or no disease. The truth state 1 indicates abnormal or disease. Higher reader scores should indicate higher likelihood or confidence of disease and low ratings should indicate lesser likelihood or confidence of disease. Otherwise, AUC calculations and ROC curve displays will be incorrect. Each field should be separated by only a comma and each row terminated by a newline character. For example, the first few rows could look like the following:

{{{
-1,1,0,1
-1,2,0,0
1,1,1,3
1,1,2,5
1,1,3,55.12
2,1,1,2
2,1,2,7
2,1,3,46.3
1,2,1,1
1,2,2,0
1,2,3,23.32
2,2,1,1
2,2,2,3
2,2,3,15.8
}}}

In the example, we see the ROC ratings from two readers reading two cases with three modalities each. The first two lines specify truth (reader = -1; modality = 0): line 1 indicates that case 1 has disease (score = 1), line 2 indicates that case 2 does not have diseased (score = 0). Rows 3-5 show reader 1’s score for modalities 1 through 3 on case 1. The sixth through eighth lines indicate the same but for reader 2 instead. The remaining lines repeat the pattern with readers 1 and 2 scoring the modalities of case 2.
