===Summary===
The primary objective of this application, iMRMC, is to assist investigators with analyzing and sizing multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) reader studies that compare the difference in the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (AUCs) from two modalities. The core features of this java application include the ability to do MRMC variance analysis, the ability to size an MRMC trial, and a database containing components of variance from past MRMC studies.

When publishing results using our software, please reference with one of the following:

  * Gallas, B. D. (2006), 'One-Shot Estimate of MRMC Variance: AUC.' _Acad Radiol_, *13* (3), 353-362.

===_Status_===
_This software is still a work in progress. We believe the variances and components of variance are very robust. We believe the p-values and confidence intervals are correct, and intend a comprehensive validation study with accompanying paper. We know there are some bugs with the sizing analysis. Please contact us with any issues by email or via the issues page._

=Current Version=
Version 2p3 posted 2014-03-05

This version provides robust data check and error reporting during the reading of the InputFile.imrmc (Identify missing truth, duplicate cases, replicated observations). Additionally, readerIDs, caseIDs, and modalityIDs can be strings. These changes allow for more flexibility and should help the user determine problems with the file format. There was a bug that was found and fixed: the coefficients were incorrectly calculated when the data was *not* fully-crossed. <br>
Power for sizing to come. <br>
This version requires a database folder named "DB" with .jdb files in the application startup directory.

==Sample Files ({{{*}}}.jdb and {{{*}}}.imrmc)==

Currently, iMRMC expects to be run in a directory with a folder named "DB" that has at least one {{{*.jdb}}} summary database file.<br>

Here are some sample {{{*}}}.imrmc input files that you can use to try the software. Some of the sample input files have common formatting errors that are detected and reported. <br>
