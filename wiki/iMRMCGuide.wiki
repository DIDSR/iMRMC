===Summary===
The primary objective of this application, iMRMC, is to assist investigators with analyzing and sizing multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) reader studies that compare the difference in the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (AUCs) from two modalities. The core features of this java application include the ability to do MRMC variance analysis, the ability to size an MRMC trial, and a database containing components of variance from past MRMC studies.

The software treats arbitrary study designs that are not "fully-crossed". Please refer to the following for more information.

===_Status_===
_The sizing analysis has been debugged and enabled once more. We believe all elements are now functioning properly. Confirmatory validation of statistical and sizing analysis by Roe and Metz simulation is planned. Please contact us with any issues by email or via the issues page._

Sizing analysis functioning. We believe it is functioning properly and are planning a validation paper. We have also added a button to view the individual reader AUCs. Analysis of individual reader AUCs is planned. <br>
