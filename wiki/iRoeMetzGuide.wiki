===Summary===
iRoeMetz is a Java application which can be used to simulate the results of a number of experiments via Monte Carlo methods given variance components of a theoretical study. These experiment results can be used in MRMC variance analysis programs such as iMRMC.

Simulation configuration files were created to replicate the simulations in Roe1997_Acad-Radiol_v4p298 and are now available. When 10,000 simulations were run, the application crashed. The corresponding memory problem was fixed.

== Simulation Configurations ==
iRoeMetz allows for using simulation configuration files. Here are the simulation configurations that replicate the original Roe and Metz simulations (Roe1997_Acad-Radiol_v4p298). <br>
