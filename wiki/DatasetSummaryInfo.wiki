This describes the basic and key information we intend to provide for each dataset.

==Basic Information==

The following fields summarize the data source, setting, experimental conditions, and reference material related to the reader ROC ratings.

  1. Source: (Owner of data, free text) Data owner or representative, affiliation, mailing address, phone, and email.

  2. Summary: (free text) A succinct description of the reader study (readers, cases, reference method, rating method) with more details on the task and modalities (treatments) under investigation.

  3. Publication: (free text) Full references to articles that describe or utilize the reader study or data. This field should also include other sources of information related to the study or data (links to webpages, protocol identifiers).
  4. Notes: (free text) This field can alert the user to any peculiar issues related to the data. For example, is there any missing data or corrections to the data?

  5. Acknowledgements: (free text)

  6. NR: (Number of readers, integer)

  7. N0: (Number of normal cases, integer)

  8. N1: (Number of abnormal cases, integer)

  9. NM: (Number of modalities, integer)

  10. AUC1: (AUC Modality 1, floating point)

  11. AUC2: (AUC Modality 2, floating point)

  12. â€¦

  13. AUCn: (AUC Modality n, floating point)

  14. DAUC: (Difference in AUCs, floating point)
