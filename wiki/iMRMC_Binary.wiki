#summary A Matlab software package for simulating, analyzing, and sizing a multi-reader multi-case reader study with binary assessments.

= Summary =
This software package provides tools that allow you:

  * Simulate binary MRMC datasets

  * Analyze a binary MRMC dataset

  * Size a binary MRMC study

= User Manual =
Please read the [http://imrmc.googlecode.com/svn/standalone_application/iMRMC_Binary_UserManual.pdf user manual] for useful information. The user manual contains 

	

  * How to use the software
	
  * Description of the simulation model
	
  * Summary of methods for data analysis and sizing 

  * References

Version 1.0 Beta posted on March 16, 2014.

The current version of the software package provieds functions for a fully-crossed design, i.e., every reader reads every case for both modalities under comparison. References are given in the user manual for alternative study designs.

The software package can run in Matlab or Octave (free).
