==Technical Specifications==

iRoeMetz is written in Java. It requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6 or 1.7 to run.

The application has been tested on the following operating systems:
  * Ubuntu Linux 12.04 32-bit, success
  * Windows 7 64-bit, success

==First Time Use==
Test that Java is working on your computer by going to
http://java.com/en/download/testjava.jsp

==Running the application==

Double click on iroemetz.jar to start the application. Alternatively, navigate to the containing folder via command line and run the command ‘java –jar iroemetz.jar’ to start the application (This requires the java system variable to be set if it has not been already. See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html).

==Inputs==

The input panel has fields to input all of the parameters of an experiment. Fields beginning with a “v” contain variances, fields beginning with a “μ” contain means, and fields beginning with an “n” contain size parameters. When iRoeMetz is started, these fields contain default values for easy testing, but these can be changed individually or cleared entirely with the “Clear Fields” button. Input parameters can be saved and loaded to/from a .irm file with the “Populate Components from File” and “Save Components to File” buttons.

==Simulation Experiments==

Once the experiment parameters have been input, we can perform the simulation experiment. There is a field to provide a seed to the random number generator. By default this field contains a number that is different each time iRoeMetz is started. If the same seed is provided to multiple sets of simulations, the results of the simulation will be the same. The next field specifies the number of experiments to be simulated at a time. The “Use Bias” check box determines if biased estimates of the moments will be used. The “Output Location” button displays a window to select the location where the reader scores of the simulated experiments will be written. A separate file will be written for the number of experiments specified. If no directory is selected, the simulation experiments will still be performed, but not written to file. Finally, the “Perform Simulation Experiments” button runs the simulations and displays the averaged results in a pop-up table.

==Calculation==

The “Perform Calculation” button performs the numerical integration calculation of the components of variance and displays them in a pop-up table.
