The basic structure of a validation study has the following steps

1. Specify simulation configurations: Generate input files that explore different simulation configurations (model parameters and experiment sizes) in order to run them in parallel.

2. Simulate the data sets. We will create a list of jobs in order to do this in parallel. Each simulation configuration will be run as a single job or a batch of jobs, depending on how many Monte Carlo (MC) trials are needed and how long it takes to run a single MC trial. For example, in order to run 100,000 MC trials of a single simulation configuration, we may create 100 jobs that run 1,000 MC trials. This will distribute the jobs across many nodes, allowing for a high level of parallelization (speed up). Special care must be paid to the random number generator (RNG) to make sure that each of the jobs is independent. We use the L'Ecuyer RNG package for this.

3. Analyze the data sets. This step may be separate for the simulation step or it may not be separate from the simulation step. For example, the MC data sets may be generated by someone else and we need to analyze the data sets. For the alternate example, the simulation may generate the MC data set and analyze it with the same program.

4. Aggregate the data: When running data in parallel, the results will be distributed across many output files. In this step, we combine all the results into a single or small number of output files.

5. Summarize the data: In this step, we process the raw simulation results into summary statistics for tables and figures that will be used in reports and manuscripts.
