Java Programming:

Package is typically defined/organized in a directory, or a directory tree.
	for example there is a directory structure mrmc/chart, mrmc/core, mrmc/gui
	these correspond to packages defined as mrmc.chart, mrmc.core, mrmc.gui

Class is typically a file in a package directory. It is assigned to a package at the top of the file
	with the line "package mrmc.gui"

When referncing classes from another package, they are imported at the top of the file
	with the line "import mrmc.core.Matrix"

Constructor has same name as class, no return type, not even void.
	It creates an object from the class.
	There may be many objects from the same class.
	There may be many costructors for a class.

Methods are class specific functions that are applied to an object in a class.

There are 3 kinds of variables + methods defined in a class before any constructors or methods are defined.
	private -- class private
	unspecified -- package private
	public -- for all to see

Static variables are part of the class, not any one object.

Within an instance method or a constructor, this is a reference to the current object — the object whose method or constructor is being called.

system.out.pringln( string );

TreeMap is a unique sorted set

ERRORS: Throwing an exception

try { 
	read_the_data
	throw new IOException( "string describing exception");
	 }
catch(IOException except){
	examine error
	except.printStackTrace();
	above, except is an IOException object
	above, printStackTrace() is a method

	show the error to the user
	System.err.println("Error" + e.getMessage());

	alternatively:
	JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(lst.getFrame(), except.getMessage(), "Error", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);
	above, lst.getFrame() must reference the current frame
		
	the "string describing exception" is stored by the getMessage() method
	("Invalid input at line " + (line_number), e);
