Gallas (BDG) decomposed the total variance into eight moments from first principles in a fashion equivalent to U-statistics, which decomposes the total variance into seven conditional covariances. The “extra moment” is the mean squared, which is a part of each conditional covariance. There is a term for non-diseased cases, diseased cases, readers, and all combinations. The decomposition treats non-diseased cases separately from diseased cases such that the total variance can be easily generalized to new readers, new non-diseased cases, and new diseased cases. </span></div>

They are marginal in the sense that they average over the non-random effects rather than conditioning on them as above. The BCK components are thought of as pure variance terms. There is a term for non-diseased cases, diseased cases, readers, and all combinations. The BCK decomposition treats non-diseased cases separately from diseased cases such that the total variance can be easily generalized to new readers, new non-diseased cases, and new diseased cases.</span></div>

The components are: reader effect, case effect, reader-case effect, modality-reader effect, modality-case effect, and modality-reader-case effect. The DBM decomposition does not treat non-diseased cases separately from diseased cases. So, while the total variance can be easily generalized to new readers and to total cases (with a fixed disease prevalence), additional modeling is needed to separately generalize to new non-diseased cases and new diseased cases (i.e., population with arbitrary disease prevalence).</span></div>

MS stands for mean squares, which are estimated from the data first and then mapped to the DBM components. There are six MS components: reader effect, case effect, reader-case effect, modality-reader effect, modality-case effect, and modality-reader-case effect. The MS decomposition does not treat non-diseased cases separately from diseased cases. So, while the total variance can be easily generalized to new readers and to total cases (with a fixed disease prevalence), additional modeling is needed to separately generalize to new non-diseased cases and new diseased cases (i.e., population with arbitrary disease prevalence).</span></div>

The components are: reader effect, modality-reader effect, same-reader-different-modality covariance, different-reader-same-modality covariance, different-reader-different-modality covariance, and residual error. The OR decomposition does not treat non-diseased cases separately from diseased cases. So, while the total variance can be easily generalized to new readers and to total cases (with a fixed disease prevalence), additional modeling is needed to separately generalize to new non-diseased cases and new diseased cases (i.e., population with arbitrary disease prevalence).</span></div>

<div class="p" style="text-align: justify; direction: ltr; margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><span class="de_CC7DAF531E">We emphasize that the software presents the four different variance decompositions of the reader average of </span><span class="de_111311456D">empirical</span><span class="de_CC7DAF531E"> AUCs estimated by U-statistics and MLE [3]. The software does not estimate the DBM and OR components as originally proposed [7, 8]. They are obtained through linear combinations of the BDG components [3]. It is worth pointing out that the U-statistics and MLE estimation methods in this software are specific to the reader average of </span><span class="de_111311456D">empirical</span><span class="de_CC7DAF531E"> AUCs, whereas the original DBM and OR </span><span class="de_111311456D">estimation</span><span class="de_CC7DAF531E"> methods can be used for other performance measures. Estimation of components when using fully-crossed data is applicable to the BDG, BCK, DBM, OR and MS decompositions. If using data with a non-fully-crossed study design, only the BDG and BCK components are currently able to be estimated. Calculations for the other decompositions are in development. </span></div>
