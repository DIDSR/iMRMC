<h4>iRoeMetz1.2</h4>
*4/8/15*

Simulation configuration files were created to replicate the the original Roe and Metz simulations (Roe, Acad Radiol, 1997, v4 p298) and are now available. 

When 10,000 simulations were run, the application crashed. The corresponding memory problem was fixed.


<h4>iRoeMetz1.1</h4>
*3/28/14*

The precision of the numerical integration method to calculate the moments of the Roe and Metz simulation model was increased. Some formatting of the GUI was changed to make the expected contents of the input boxes more clear.
